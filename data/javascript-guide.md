# JavaScript Fundamentals

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript has several data types including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. Variables can be declared using var, let, or const keywords.

## Functions

Functions in JavaScript can be declared using the function keyword or as arrow functions. They are first-class objects and can be passed as arguments to other functions.

## DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) allows JavaScript to interact with HTML elements. You can select elements using methods like getElementById, querySelector, and addEventListener.

## Async Programming

JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. This is essential for handling API calls and user interactions.

## ES6 Features

Modern JavaScript includes features like template literals, destructuring, spread operator, and modules that make code more readable and maintainable.
