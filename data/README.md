# Data Folder

Place your markdown files here. The RAG system will process these files and add them to the knowledge base.

## Usage

1. Add `.md` files to this folder
2. Use the command "Load data files" in the chat to process all markdown files
3. The system will automatically chunk and embed the content

## Supported Format

- Markdown files (.md)
- Content will be processed by sections (split by headers)
- Each section becomes a separate knowledge base entry
