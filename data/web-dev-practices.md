# Web Development Best Practices

## Code Organization

Keep your code well-organized with clear file structures, meaningful variable names, and consistent formatting. Use tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize HTTP requests
- Optimize images and assets
- Use CDNs for static content
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files

## Security Considerations

Always validate user input, use HTTPS, implement proper authentication and authorization, and keep dependencies updated to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Responsive Design

Design your websites to work across all device sizes using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries. Test on multiple devices and browsers.

## Accessibility

Make your websites accessible to all users by using semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast, and keyboard navigation support.
